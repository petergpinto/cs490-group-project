## Alpha milestone

Must run on afsaccess4
1. One login screen for 2 levels of access: Teacher and Student.
2. Three demos: Teacher, Student, bad credentials. The successful login 
should send a Teacher to a Teacher landing page. The Student should be 
sent to the Student landing page. Unsuccessful remains at the log in 
screen.
3. You must follow the given architecture. You must each run your own 
code from your own AFS account. If you deviate from that your entire 
group will earn a zero.
4. You must upload your individual contribution to your group project to 
earn credit.
